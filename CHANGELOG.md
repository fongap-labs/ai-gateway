# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

- fix: make default gateway policy production-ready: AGENT keys inherit the known Code model family when no allowlist is supplied, Air uses fast routing, and Pro/Max/Ultra use a 180s long-reasoning failover budget with explicit policy overrides preserved.

- refactor: align merge CI with Action Worker using ci-evidence and centralized PR Governance.

- fix: drive dashboard quick-start access groups and public endpoint from runtime configuration instead of front-end constants.

- fix: rotate to another upstream after a node-local HTTP 400 rejection instead of terminating the whole request.

- fix: update the Fongap Labs dashboard link to https://labs.fongap.com.

- fix: default deployment to enabled and derive repository identity from GitHub context.
- refactor [breaking, migration]: hard cut gateway access, deployment, node-shard, credential-shard, binding, timeout, cooldown, and Boolean configuration names; derive Action Worker dispatch target from GITHUB_REPOSITORY_OWNER.
